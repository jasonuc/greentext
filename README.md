## Usage

Hereâ€™s how you can generate your very own green-text meme:

### Example Command

```bash
greentext -l 13 -t https://wojakdb.com/data/posts/3571_9009cb2dd906dccb.png -o meme.png
```

- `-l`: Number of lines to include in the green-text.
- `-t`: Path to a thumbnail image or URL (optional).
- `-o`: Output file name.

#### Additional Flags

- `--background-color`, `-b`: Set the background color for the meme in HEX format (e.g., `#FFFFFF` for white, default: `#f0e0d6`).
- `--text-color`, `-c`: Set the text color for the greentext lines in HEX format (e.g., `#00FF00` for green, default: `#819f32`).
- `--font`, `-f`: Specify the font family for the entire meme (e.g., `"Courier New"`, default: `"Roboto Mono"`).
- `--font-size`, `-s`: Specify the font size for the greentext lines in pixels (e.g., `14`, default: `12`).
- `--input-file`, `-i`: Provide a text file containing greentext lines (one line per entry).
- `--preview-only`, `-P`: Open the meme in the browser without saving it.

### Example Input

When prompted, enter your meme lines:

```text
> be me
> decide to write a meme generator in Go
> "how hard could image manipulation be?"
> 3 hours in, still trying to draw a rectangle
> find 5 different libraries that almost do what I want
> none of them support rounded corners
> consider switching to Python
> remember I already told everyone Go is the best
> silently suffer
> finally get it working
> "go build -o bin/greentext"
> runtime panic: freetype called with nil font
> tfw image manipulation in Go makes you question life
```

### Example Output

This command will generate a beautiful green-text meme like this:
